## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze sales performance across states, product categories, months, and quarters.
- Identify high-revenue regions and products.
- Evaluate seasonal trends in orders and revenue.
- Present insights through a clean, interactive Excel dashboard.
- Provide business recommendations based on data findings.

  ## Data Cleaning & Preparation
  The following steps were performed before analysis:
  - Removed blank and inconsistent records.
  - Standardized category and state names.
  - Converted date fields into Month, Quarter, and Year.
  - Created derived fields for analytical purposes.
  - Ensured consistent currency and numeric formatting.
 
    ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
    The dashboard focuses on the following KPIs:
    - Total Revenue
    - Total Orders
    - Average Order Value (AOV)
    - Total Units Sold
    - Profit Margin (Assumed 15%)
   
    > [!Note:]
    > Since the dataset did not include profit information, a uniform 15% profit margin was assumed across all transactions for analytical purposes.

    ## Key Insights
    - Maharashtra contributes the highest share of total revenue among all states.
    - Set, Kurta, and Western Dress categories drive the majority of category-level revenue.
    - April and May show peak monthly revenue, followed by a moderate decline in June.
    - Q2 significantly outperforms Q1 in terms of total orders and revenue contribution.
   
    ## Business Recommendations
    - Introduce targeted promotions in Q1 to improve order volume during low-demand periods.
    - Apply dicounts and focused marketing on low-performing categories such as Ethnic Wear and Sarees.
    - Increase marketing spend in high-revenue states (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh) to maximize ROI.
    - Re-evaluate product mix in low-revenue regions (e.g., Lakshadweep, Mizoram, Nagaland) and consider promoting Western wear in regions with lower demand for traditional apparel.
